I am currently a PhD student at the Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota. I got my master's degree in economics at the University of Zurich.

I have a broad interest in policy, technology, and society. My research interests lie in the intersection of technology and policy, exploring how technological innovations shape and are shaped by regulatory frameworks and public policy decisions.
