## RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

**Poverty Reduction or Data Manipulation? Developmental Effect of the Targeted Poverty Alleviation Campaign in China**  
*Master Thesis Supervised by Prof. David Hémous | Spring 2023*  
- Empirically examine the developmental impacts of place-based development policies by studying the Targeted Poverty Alleviation (TPA) campaign in China and highlight the important role of centralized administrative structure in shaping the impacts of place-based development policies.
- Use ArcGIS and STATA to construct two micro-level datasets:  
  1) A county-level panel dataset from 2005 to 2019 containing detailed information on GDP, nighttime luminosity, population, and business registration records.  
  2) A village-level panel dataset on nighttime luminosity and population.
- Conduct prefectural, county-level, and village-level difference-in-differences (DID) analysis and event studies using STATA.
- Find that the TPA campaign hinders local economic development as measured by nighttime luminosity and a more centralized administrative system reduces the negative effects of the TPA campaign on local development.

- Provide a behavioral diagnosis from the perspectives of motivation, self-control, and inattention.
- Conduct interviews with 20 qualified potential beneficiaries of the supplementary benefits and study existing policies targeting the non-taking-up problem.

**The Impact of Public Support on Firms' Performance**  
*Fall 2022 | Term Paper (Supervised by Prof. Worter Martin)*  
- Examine the role that public support plays in promoting research and development.
- Employ a unique micro panel dataset that combines firms' specific information about R&D behavior, performance, and characteristics from KOF (Swiss Economic Institute).
- Conduct a difference-in-differences (DID) analysis with multiple data periods using STATA.
- Find no crowding-out effects between public support and private R&D expenditures, but firms might rely more on the human resources of research institutes after being exposed to additional R&D cooperation.
